<p>I have redefined my research subject after the last discussion: <br>
<mark><strong>How and What should the Youth learn in the digital media environment.</strong></mark></p>

<p>The following is could be the initial structure and main content of my thesis. I maybe will refine it according to the reading and research that I find.</p>

<hr>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Skills</strong> <br>
In this section I will talk about What we should learn before we learn in the digital media world, I mainly refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century_skills">21st century skills</a> and Henry Jenkins’s <a href="https://www.curriculum.org/secretariat/files/Sept30TLConfronting.pdf">Confronting the Challenges of Participatory Culture: Media Education for the 21st Century</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Products</strong> <br>
In this part I try to analyze the existing forms of digital learning products e.g. <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002451/245122E.pdf">Mooc</a>, Connected learning and so forth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Youth</strong> <br>
I borrowed the definition of <strong>Youth</strong> from the book of Henry Jenkins <em>By Any Media Necessary - The New Youth Activism</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this book, the term “youth” refers to people in their teens or twenties. It defines not simply a stage of physiological or psychological development, but also a stage in the process of acquiring the skills necessary for political participation at an age where there is less than complete access to the rights of citizenship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore in this section I try to research what do the Youth need/behavior during the processing of learning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Participations</strong> <br>
It seems that no matter what form of digital learning we can not avoid not talking about Participation. So this part will be around the engagement of youth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Case Study</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Project</strong></p></li>
</ol>
